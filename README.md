# Introduction

Hello! You can call me Rian, or Reza. People around me prefer to call me Rian, but I do not mind being called both. I am from Indonesia.

## Position

I am currently a student studying abroad in Malaysia.

As a side interest, I am one of the project leads of [osu!droid](https://github.com/osudroid), and responsible for its Discord community.

## Projects

You can head to my repository list to see the repositories that I maintain. Here's a quick overview of them:

-   [osu!droid](https://github.com/osudroid/osu-droid), a free-to-win rhythm game for Android devices based on the rhythm game [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh).
-   [Alice](https://github.com/Rian8337/Alice), a multipurpose Discord bot focused on osu!droid and its international [Discord server](https://discord.gg/nyD92cE).
-   [Elaina PP Project](https://github.com/Rian8337/droidppboard), a project that measures the difficulty of a beatmap inside osu!droid and the grade of performance of its scores. This project is hosted inside the Discord server and has multiple supporting components:
    -   A [processing server](https://github.com/Rian8337/dpp-processor-backend) that acts as the central hub of score and replay calculation across all my osu!droid infrastructure that requires such task.
    -   A [replay server](https://github.com/Rian8337/dpp-replay-backend) for receiving scores directly from the game's server and forwarding it to the processing server.
-   [osu!droid module](https://github.com/Rian8337/osu-droid-module), a collection of modules for osu!droid and osu!(standard). It contains a core package that interops between osu!droid and osu!(standard), a difficulty calculator for osu!droid and osu!(standard), an osu!droid replay analyzer, osu!droid-related utilities, and a difficulty strain graph generator. This is where the calculation algorithm of Elaina PP Project is hosted.
-   [osu!droid Spectator Client](https://github.com/Rian8337/osu-droid-spectator), a website for spectating a multiplayer game in osu!droid using a custom game client.
-   [osu!droid `skin.json` editor](https://github.com/Rian8337/skin-json-editor), a tool for creating and editing `skin.json` files that are used by skins in osu!droid.
